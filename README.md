Demo E-commerce Project
This is a Demo E-commerce application built using C#, .NET Core MVC, and SQL Server. The goal of this project is to demonstrate key backend development practices such as CRUD operations, Authentication & Authorization, and the use of the Repository Pattern and DTOs for data management.

Key Features:

User Authentication & Authorization: Users are assigned roles (Guest, User, Admin) with customized views and operations. Each role has specific access to features and pages within the app.
CRUD Operations: Products can be managed with full CRUD capabilities (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Repository Pattern and Service Layer for business logic.
DTO and Manual Mapping: Products are transferred using DTOs, ensuring separation of concerns between the data model and the API response. Manual mapping is used for transforming between DTOs and models.
SQL Server Database: Data is stored and retrieved from a SQL Server database, using Entity Framework and LINQ for querying and data manipulation.
Clean Code & SOLID Principles: The application follows best practices including SOLID principles, proper exception handling, and validation to ensure scalability and maintainability.
UI Design: The front end is built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, providing a simple, clean, and responsive interface.
